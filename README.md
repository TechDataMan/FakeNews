## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

The CapStone project is one of the projects within the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. The WELFake dataset was chosen as the data basis.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

The 2024 Stack Overflow survey includes around 65k reviews from 185 countries all around the world. The focus of the survey is to understand significant aspects of jobs in software development.</br>
The data of survey contains of the following two CSV files:
<ul>
  <li>schema of the survey data, containing information about the more than 100 columns (i.e., questions) used within the survey
  <li>survey results, containing thousands of individual answers to the survey questions 
</ul>

Further information about the original dataset can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/4561253)

## Files <a name="files"></a>

The following files are provided within this project:
<ul>
  <li><b>FAKENews.ipynb:</b> Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the analysis</li>
  <li><b>README.md:</b> This file</li>
</ul>

## Libraries <a name="libraries"></a>

I created a Jupyter notebook (Python) for the data analysis. For this I used the integrated workspaces from Udacity. The ipynb file should run on any Python 3 version (3.0.* or higher) without any problems.</br>

Here are the additional Python libraries used within this project:
<ul>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Matplotlib.PyPlot</li>
  <li>scikit-learn</li>
</ul>

You will need to download the WELFake dataset and put it in your folder. [Here](https://zenodo.org/records/4561253) you can find the data. </br>

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The aim of the analysis was to find out whether machine learning algorithms and natural language processing can be used to distinguish/classify real articles from fake articles. The results can be found on my GitHub [Blog](https://techdataman.github.io/2024/10/11/blog-post-second.html).

## Licensing <a name="licensing"></a>

Thanks to XXX for providing the data.
